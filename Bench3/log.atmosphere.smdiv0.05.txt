  Timer information:
     Globals are computed across all threads and processors
 
  Columns:
     total time: Global max of accumulated time spent in timer
     calls: Total number of times this timer was started / stopped.
     min: Global min of time spent in a single start / stop
     max: Global max of time spent in a single start / stop
     avg: Global max of average time spent in a single start / stop
     pct_tot: Percent of the timer at level 1
     pct_par: Percent of the parent timer (one level up)
     par_eff: Parallel efficiency, global average total time / global max total time
